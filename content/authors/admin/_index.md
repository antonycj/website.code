I am currently a PhD student of Political Science in the [Truman School of Government and Public Affairs](https://truman.missouri.edu/people/jackson) and a graduate fellow at the [Kinder Institute on Constitutional Democracy](https://democracy.missouri.edu/directory/?department=graduate-fellows). I received my MA in Atlantic History and Politics from the University of Missouri and my BA in Political Science from Utah Valley University. I am interested in American political development and the relationship between political institutions and ideas in Early Republic. In particular, I am interested in observing the evolution of state constitutions during the Early Republic.
